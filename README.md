# Memory notes

Memory Notes is a compact blog designed to document useful information, code snippets, and brief notes for future reference. The primary goal is to create a personal knowledge base that can be revisited when needed. However, if this repository proves beneficial to others in their learning journey, that would be a bonus.

Memory Notes is hosted on GitHub Pages and can be accessed at [ksysoev.github.io](https://ksysoev.github.io/)

The blog is built using Hugo, a popular static site generator. This allows for efficient rendering of content and easy deployment to GitHub Pages.
